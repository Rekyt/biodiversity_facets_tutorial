# MMGC - Practical session 01 - “Biodiversity facets in macro-space”

This the first practical session in the course “Macroecology and
Macroevolution under Global Change”. This practical session is going to
be linked to lectures 2 and 3 on biodiversity facets.

**Year**: 2021

**Instructors**: Matthias Grenié & Marten Winter

Contact us via Slack or email for any further questions.

## Goals

-   Manipulate research open data
-   Learning how to compute functional diversity indices with
    `fundiversity`
-   Learning how to compute phylogenetic diversity indices with `ape`
-   Know the difference between facets of functional and phylogenetic
    diversity indices
-   Visualize biodiversity facets on the map
-   Show the effect of logging in a tropical forest context on some
    biodiversity facets

## How to use it?

## Data provenance

## Going Further

Other courses on biodiversity facets and potential interesting papers:

-   The [`FD`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=FD) package is the
    reference package to compute functional diversity indices.
