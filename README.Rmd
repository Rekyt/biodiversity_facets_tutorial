# Macroecology and Macroevolution under Global Changes - Practical session 01 - "Biodiversity facets in macro-space"

This the first practical session in the course "Macroecology and Macroevolution under Global Change". This practical session is going to be linked to lectures 2 and 3 on biodiversity facets.

**Year**: 2021

**Instructors**: Matthias Grenié & Marten Winter

Contact us via Slack or email for any further questions.


## Goals

* Manipulate research open data
* Learning how to compute functional diversity indices with `fundiversity`
* Learning how to compute phylogenetic diversity indices with `ape`
* Know the difference between facets of functional and phylogenetic diversity indices
* Visualize biodiversity facets on the map
* Show the effect of logging in a tropical forest context on some biodiversity facets

## How to use it?

You can view the tutorial through the associated website: https://rekyt.github.io/biodiversity_facets_tutorial/

In case there is a problem you can access a similar version on https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Rekyt/biodiversity_facets_tutorial/blob/main/docs/index.html

## Data provenance

The data we'll be using throughout the tutorial comes from the following article: 

> Döbert, T.F., Webber, B.L., Sugau, J.B., Dickinson, K.J.M. and Didham, R.K. (2017), Logging increases the functional and phylogenetic dispersion of understorey plant communities in tropical lowland rain forest. J Ecol, 105: 1235-1245. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12794

The data has been deposited on a open data repository called dryad with the following reference:

> Döbert, Timm F. et al. (2018), Data from: Logging increases the functional and phylogenetic dispersion of understorey plant communities in tropical lowland rainforest, Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f77p7

## Going Further

Other courses on biodiversity facets and potential interesting papers & tools:

* The [`FD`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=FD) package is the reference package to compute functional diversity indices.
